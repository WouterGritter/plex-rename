# plex-rename

A small pipeline for renaming files in your legally obtained plex library. This (currently) does not contain any sort of GUI, and will require modifying the code in `Main.java` each time you want to rename a different set of files. The pipeline makes heavy use of regex in order to get the right bits of information out of a filename.
